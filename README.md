## Description
    1) The naval battle board must be 10X10 for each player.

    2) The program must randomly (randomly) scatter 5 boats to each player,
       hiding them even from their jewelers.
 
    3) Each boat occupies only one cell in the matrix, that is, row, column position.

    4) Have each player enter their move in a user-friendly interface, entering row column.

    5) Test whether the position has already been played, whether or not there is a boat. And as the opponent hits a boat, show the board with the boat.

    6) After each move, present the board with the moves represented by "X" if you hit the boat or "O" if you hit water.

    7) Below the board, show the game score, that is, how many boats each opponent hit.

    8) Allow the game to be restarted without the need to restart the program.
